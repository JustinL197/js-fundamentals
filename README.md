# JavaScript Fundamentals (Practice & TDD)

This repository is a personal collection of JavaScript exercises and small problems.
Each exercise is written as a standalone function with accompanying Jest tests (where applicable)

The goals are to:
- Practice JavaScript fundamentals (strings, arrays, loops, recursion, etc.).
- Learn and apply test-driven development (TDD) using Jest.
- Track progress and growth in problem-solving.
- Build consistent habits with git/GitHub version control.

## Contents

- Strings
  - Palindrome (src/strings/palindrome)
  - More to come...
- Arrays
  - Coming soon...
- Math
  - Coming soon...

## Approach

- Write tests first (expected behavior).
- Implement minimal code to pass tests.
- Refactor while keeping tests green.
- Commit each meaningful step.

---

## Roadmap

- Add more string, array, and algorithm exercises.
- Explore recursion and functional programming patterns.
- More to come as I progress through my learning.
